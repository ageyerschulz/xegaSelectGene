Description: A collection of gene representation independent 
             mechanisms for evolutionary and genetic algorithms:
             First, functions for selecting a gene 
             in a population of genes according to its fitness value
             and for adaptive scaling of the fitness as well as for 
             performance optimization and measurement.
             Second, variants of evaluation functions for 
             deterministic and stochastic functions as well as 
             for gene repair. 
             Third, timing and counting functions for profiling the
             algorithm pipeline. 
             Fourth, a small collection of problem environments
             for function optimization, combinatorial optimization, and
             grammar-based genetic programming and grammatical evolution.
